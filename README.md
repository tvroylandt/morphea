# Morphea - My own tweets search engine

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Leitmotiv

I wrote [Morphea](morphea.netlify.app) because I like Twitter a lot. I use likes ("favorites") in order to keep track of interesting content.
Often, I need to search back in my likes history to find an old (or a recent) resource. This task is complicated due to Twitter interface.

So Morphea is a simple and nice table with my tweets and search functionalities.

The name is inspired by Morpheus, greek god of sleep ("Morphée" in French) since all of this works without me pushing things manually.

## How

I design a full pipeline using Github Actions to have my tweets pulled from Twitter and put inside the table.

You can learn more about it by reading this blog post : [tillac blog post](link).

## To come after that

I also plan to add two main things to Morphea :

+ my navigator bookmarks, which will need manual transfer and deduplication with tweets ;
+ add a clustering algorithm or a manual taxonomy to find things more easily.

## Misc
